# CBBModel
A simple linear regression model to predict the point spread of a college basketball game.

If you have stumbled upon this repository in search of a starting point to build your own model, know that this model is largely untested and **I would not recommend using it for actual betting on college basketball games**. 

However, while building and testing my own model, I did scrape large amounts of game data from https://sports-reference.com that may be helpful to you. That is in this repository as well.
